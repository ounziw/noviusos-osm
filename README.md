OSM for Novius OS
==================

An Novius OS application to create an OSM map (iframe style) and display it.

Many thanks to [Open Street Map](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) and everybody who commits OSM.

**Install**

Copy these files into your Novius OS's local/application.
Go to your Novius OS's admin area, and activate "Open Street Map".
In the wysiwyg editor on Page, click "Application", and you will find Open Street Map.

**Use**

You will find "Click to Show Map" on the popup screen. Please click it, then you will get an OSM map. (It may take time, since the map data will come via internet.)
